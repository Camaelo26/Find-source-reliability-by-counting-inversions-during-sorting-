# Find-source-reliability-by-counting-inversions-during-sorting-
In web applications, combining ranks from diverse sources is vital. This project modifies Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and a custom algorithm to enhance combined rank accuracy. The adaptation includes a reliability metric based on inversion count, crucial for assessing source reliability in meta-search engines.
